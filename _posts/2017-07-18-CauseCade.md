## CauseCade

CauseCade is a web-based Bayesian Network tool. [Bayesian networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) (also known as belief networks, or Bayes Network) are ... 
This means this network can say something about probability of events. While this may not seem super useful there are certainly a plethera of applications for such a thing.

There are many great tools available to create a Bayesian Network (see the corresponding post on this blog). What this aims to do, is to make them accessible to everyone who wishes to learn about them.
the purpose is thus to educate users about the functioning and applications of bayesian networks. For this a web-based interface is easiest, as it requires minimal effort for users to get started. 

CauseCade is written in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/), and uses [Angular](https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular) to keep everything tidy and functional. The code for CauseCade can freely be accessed at the [corresponding github](https://github.com/sandcrawler/CauseCade) page.
The code and general coding practices are not anything to write home about, but the *personal* goal of CauseCade was to do a big programming project in a new programming language that can teach others. CauseCade will therefore be updated over time in a gradual manner.
