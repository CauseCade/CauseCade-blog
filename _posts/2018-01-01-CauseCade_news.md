## Administration

CauseCade has now been moved to a separate GitHub repository where everything is now kept. This makes it easier to go through and
understand the inner workings of CauseCade. It can be accessed here: [CauseCade on GitHub](https://github.com/CauseCade).

## Features

A lot has happened in the past few months. Networks can now be clicked on for easy navigation, and the visualisation methods are
now much more intuitive. The charts are now much more readable, the load component is now fully functional, and networks can be
reset without having to reload the entire page. Google Analytics have been added to look at traffic. The teaching mode now also has
all the critical functionality.

## Content

Many new example networks have been created. These new networks each belong to a course lesson, and can be loaded with ease. Many
new lessons have also been written covering the basics of baysian networks, with more to come. For content creation, there is now an easy 
JSON format that anyone can work with in order to make and save their own networks. Information on this can be found in the 
[CauseCade documentation](https://github.com/CauseCade/CauseCade-documentation).
