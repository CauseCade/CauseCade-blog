## Netica

[Netica](https://www.norsys.com/netica.html) is software written by the [Norsys Software Corp.](https://www.norsys.com/). Their website describes the software as:
>Netica is a powerful, easy-to-use, complete program for working with belief networks and influence diagrams. It has an intuitive and smooth user interface for drawing the networks, and the relationships between variables may be entered as individual probabilities, in the form of equations, or learned from data files (which may be in ordinary tab-delimited form and have "missing data").

Netica has a free demo, which allows one to get a taste for their software, but is a very limited version, making it of rather limited use. In CauseCade, some of the examples available are modified versions of examples in this free version. The full software can be purchased, but is very expensive. Netica is therefore not a great way to get started with Bayesian Networks.

## Banjo

[Banjo](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~amink/software/banjo/) describes itself as follows:
>Banjo is a software application and framework for structure learning of static and dynamic Bayesian networks, developed under the direction of Alexander J. Hartemink in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University. Banjo was designed from the ground up to provide efficient structure inference when analyzing large, research-oriented data sets, while at the same time being accessible enough for students and researchers to explore and experiment with the algorithms. Because it is implemented in Java, the framework is easy to maintain and extend.

As you can see, Banjo can be downloaded and used non commercially.This means Banjo is potentially a good place to get started with Bayesian Networks, as one can also use the advanced features. In contrast to CauseCade, the software needs to be downloaded for the software to be run. Aditionally, the software is not an explanatory tool, unlike CauseCade.

## Bayesialab
[Bayesialab](http://www.bayesialab.com/) is software developed  by [Bayesia](http://www.bayesia.com/). An exerpt form their website:
>BayesiaLab's inference algorithms allow users to leverage Bayesian network models for complex evidential reasoning, even under uncertainty. In this context, BayesiaLab is unique in its ability to perform both observational and causal inference, facilitating a correct simulation of interventions in a system.

Similar to Netica, their software is not free, but a free trial version is available. Compared to Netica and Banjo, Bayesialab has a more modern user interface that I personally consider to be more intuitive. While their software is not an explanatory tool, they do provide a free ebook that goes into the detailed functioning and reasoning behind bayesian networks.

## CauseCade

So, how does CauseCade compare to the above? CauseCade is made as an explanatory tool. Think of it as a very interactive pdf. Rather than focussing on the most efficient inference algorithms, it focuses on visualisation and education. The goal is not to match or surpass the features offered by these existing (non)commercial software packages, but to match the basic features and explain the foundation of bayesian networks. Once users thoroughly understand bayesian networks through CauseCade, they may wish to use them in real applications using the above (or other) software packages that are geared more towards applying bayesian networks.
