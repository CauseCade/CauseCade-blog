## Feedback

<p>I appreciate to hear from the users what they would like to see in the future and what needs to be changed. I am, however, doing a degree as of this post, which means that I wont have time to work on CauseCade on a consistent time schedule. 
Contact can be through the google plus page, or directed at *nemoandrea@outlook.com* </p>

## Google Plus Page

<p> While i'm sure this is about as degenerate of a communication medium as possible, it is what I have chosen to use for now.
I have created a [google+ page]() where people can post their experiences and thoughts on causecade. Bugs can also be reported here. I don't expect large user interaction, so I think google+ will have to do for now.</p>
