summary:    A brief guide on how to use CauseCade. This guide will eventually become available in CauseCade itself.

## Let's get started

So, how does one use CauseCade? As CauseCade is in early development, the UI is rather unpolished and may be unintuitive at times. 
Additionally, a guide (or introduction, if you will) to CauseCade will eventually be integrated into CauseCade itself, improving the experience.
For now, you'll have to just remember what is stated in this blog post and try it for yourself next time you visit CauseCade (the red button in the top right of the screen will get you there).
I recommend you therefore  try out the menus and things explained in this post immediately after reading this post. It won't take long, and will ensure you understand what CauseCade can do at the current time.

## The Starting Screen

Above, I have listed the thing you will see once you enter CauseCade (and have closed the welcome diaglogue).
I have marked the relevant regions with the following colours: Blue, Green, Purple, Pink, Yellow. I will describe what each region does
in the sections below. 

### The external links (green)
This region holds links to external pages, as well as features related to the functioning of CauseCade. 
This section is accessed only if you have questions or comments on CauseCade and is not central to it's functioning.
The *help* section is currently not functional, but will in the future be used to open up the tutorial and other informative dialogs.
The *blog* link will direct you to this blog, and will open in a new tab. The *report bug* link will bring you to a google plus community page where users can
leave comments on CauseCade about multiple aspects, as well as reports any bugs that they found.

### The Node Information Selector (blue)
These three tabs (only one can be selected at a time) each display different information about a node in the network.
The *overview* tab gives basic information about a node, the *details* tab will display information that will be dispensable for most inspections of the network, the *edit* tab allows users to change properties of a node.
Note that: For these tabs to do anything, a node **must be selected**. This can be done in the Controls section (yellow).

### The Network Visualisation Selector (purple)
*This section is currenly not functional.* This section will (in the future) allow users to choose between different visual representations of the network.
The only visualisation method currently available is the *network* mode, which is just the traditional directed acyclic graph representaiton. This is also the most intuitive visualisation.

### The Network Control Menu (yellow)
This menu will allow you to control the network you have loaded. Three buttons are visible: save (currently unavailable), load, and reset ((currently unavailable)).
*Load* will open up a dialog that lists the currently available [example networks](/CauseCade-blog/_posts/2017-07-17-Examples.md). From here, an example network can be loaded.
Loading multiple example networks at once will (currently) break the network, and is not recommended. The search field will allow users to select a node. Naturally, for this to work, a network must be loaded in.
The search box is case sensitive. By inspecting the names of the nodes in the network visualisation (in CauseCade), you can find the names of the nodes. 
Once a node has been found (i.e you entered a valid name in the search box), the *overview* menu will open for that node. You can then use the *node information selector (blue)* to futher explore the node.

### The Node Adder (pink)

This button will be present in the bottom right of CauseCade at all times. This button can be used to add new nodes to the network.
Clicking it will open a dialogue which allows users to enter the name, and how many different *states* the node can have. Addtionally, user can specify the links between this new node and the existing nodes.
The links and number of states can be changed later, but the name is permanent.

## That's it!

I hope that explained the basic layout and function of buttons in CauseCade. A more detailed tutorial will be made available in the future.
More documentation (on how to use a bayesian network) will be published at a later date (both in blog post form and pdf).

*Don't forget to try it yourself in [CauseCade](https://sandcrawler.github.io/CauseCade-deploy/)!*
